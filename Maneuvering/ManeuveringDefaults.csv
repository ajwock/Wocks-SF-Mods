//The rate at which acceleration can change.  1 is actually a somewhat large value.
//This value determines responsiveness of acceleration- set equal to MaxAcceleration for the maximum responsiveness.
//I just don't like playing that way because it's so jerky.
Setting,ForwardJerk,1
//The rate at which braking can change.  Basically the same as ForwardJerk.
Setting,BreakingJerk,1
//The maximum acceleration with no improvement from ramjet effect.  100 is a very large value.
Setting,MaxAcceleration,100
//Maximal breaking magnitude.  Speed can be reduced more quickly due to breaking working with drag and gravity while climbing, not against it.
Setting,MaxBreaking,15
//Not yet implemented- intended to smoothen controls at higher speeds.
Setting,Vectoring,5
//The "normal top speed" of the game.  When set to 1250 and the player doesn't thrust or break, the game plays just like normal.
Setting,RegularTopSpeed,1250
//Ramjet effect:  As speed increases, so does thrust.
//A constant governing how much ramjet effect there is.  When set to 0 there is no ramjet effect.
Setting,RamJetConstant,0
//A constant that determines how quickly thrust grows with respect to speed.  
//If the Ramjet growth power is greater than the Drag growth power, there is no limit to top speed, which isn't a good thing.
//This is an exponent value, by the way.  Thrust grows proportionally to currentSpeed ^ RamJetGrowthPower.
Setting,RamJetGrowthPower,1
//A constant governing how much drag there is when speed is in excess- that is, currentSpeed - RegularTopSpeed > 0.
Setting,ExcessiveSpeedDragConstant,25
//A constant that determines how quickly drag grows with respect to excess speed-
//drag grows proportionally to (currentSpeed - RegularTopSpeed) ^ DragGrowthPower.
Setting,DragGrowthPower,2
//A modifier meant to prevent explosions in acceleration between frames as a result of exponential growth in drag.
//Probably best not to touch this.
Setting,SmoothnessConstant,.001

//Actual top speed is a complicated function of MaxAcceleration, RegularTopSpeed, RamJetConstant,
//RamJetGrowthPower, ExcessiveSpeedDragConstant, DragGrowthPower, and SmoothnessConstant.
//And also probably some variables hardcoded into the vanilla game that I don't have access to.
