# Maneuvering

An improvement to the players control over their speed derived from the SF-Mod's Jetpack.
Jetpack simply allowed the player to apply an acceleration value.
With this mod, you can:

Both accelerate and break.
Accelerate and break much more smoothly due to the availability of nonzero jerk (the derivative of acceleration).
Change the regular top speed.
Exceed even that top speed when thrusting- the true top speed is determined from variables that increase engine power and drag when exceeding the regular top speed.
Determine how drag works when regular top speed is exceeded.
Thrust as though your character has a ramjet engine- you can get additional power with additonal speed.
Alternatively setting the ramjet constant to a negative value can let you boost powerfully at low speeds but have that power sharply taper off.

**Note:** This mod disables high score reporting.
